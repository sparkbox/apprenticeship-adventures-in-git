# Hello there

Hello everyone! My name is Jared Kohrt and I'm a new apprentice at Sparkbox! Right now, I'm working remotely from Greensboro, NC, which means I'm on Eastern Standard time and my preferred pronouns are he/him.

One thing I'm excited about learning is SCSS--I really want to level up my front-end skills.

## Icebreakers

* What technology innovation made the most impact on your life?
VoIP apps have let me keep in touch with my friends even when we went our separate ways. I don't think I would have as many good friends today if I hadn't been able to talk with them over the internet.

* Desktop, laptop, or tablet? Which do you prefer to use?
Desktop--I built a PC in high school that I'm very attached to!
