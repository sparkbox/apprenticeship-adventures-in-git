# Hello there

Hello everyone! My name is Marissa and I'm a new apprentice at Sparkbox! Right now, I'm working remotely from Troy, MI, which means I'm on Eastern time and my preferred pronouns are she/her/hers.

One of my favorite things about programming is the building and creating aspect. One thing I'm excited about learning is React...and Git...and anything backend related since I don't have any experience with that...there's a lot I'm excited about!

## Icebreakers

* What technology innovation made the most impact on your life
I don't have a great answer for that yet. I'm part of that generation that sort of grew up analog, and transitioned into digital. The access to an abundance of information on the web is something that we just take for granted now, but it wasn't really like that even 30 years ago! 

* Desktop, laptop, or tablet? Which do you prefer to use?
Laptop, but with an extra monitor :fire:
